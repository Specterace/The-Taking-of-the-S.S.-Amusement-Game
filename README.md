# The-Taking-of-the-S.S.-Amusement-Game

This was a game I helped develop (as part of a five-person team) for my COMPSCI 113 Game Development class. It is a 2D side-scrolling roguelike Metroidvania game where the objective is to progress through a platforming level (which is full of enemies) and 2 boss enemies.

Our team also set up a website as part of this project: https://crayonfiregames.wordpress.com/
